As 2025 turned out to be a shorter event compared to previous years, I thought
it would be intriguing to try a challenge: tackling each day in a different
programming language.

With my background as a primarily back-end developer, you might find that
front-end languages are not well represented here.

In contrast, you'll see a stronger presence of systems programming languages,
along with some inclusion of scientific computing languages.

Here are the languages and solutions:

- [Day 1— Nim](aoc-2025-day-01/)
- [Day 2— Julia](aoc-2025-day-02/)
- [Day 3— D](aoc-2025-day-03/)
- [Day 4— Racket](aoc-2025-day-04/)
- [Day 5— Crystal](aoc-2025-day-05/)
- [Day 6— C++](aoc-2025-day-06/)
- [Day 7— Lisp](aoc-2025-day-07/)
- [Day 8— Go](aoc-2025-day-08/)
- [Day 9— Python](aoc-2025-day-09/)
- [Day 10— Rust](aoc-2025-day-10/)
- [Day 11— Haskell](aoc-2025-day-11/)
- [Day 12— Kotlin](aoc-2025-day-12/)

I wasn’t fully happy with my original Day 10 solution, so I revisited it and
crafted a new version based on a post in
[r/adventofcode](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/).
You can find more information in [Day 10 Redux](aoc-2025-day-10-redux/).

A heartfelt thank you goes out to Eric Wastl for his unwavering dedication to
this annual event, which has truly become a highlight of the software
development calendar.
