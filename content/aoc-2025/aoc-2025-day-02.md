The Julia Github repo has this to say about the language:

Like many languages focussed on numerical computing, Julia has 1-based array
indexing.  I don't think this is a major issue, but I imagine it would be
something that would occasionaly trip up folks coming from 0-based languages
while they adjust.

Visual Studio Code support for Julia is excellent.

## The Code

One interesting feature is the use of Unicode operators.  While using the ÷
symbol for integer division looks neat, it presents a visual tripping hazard,
and at a quick glance, `n÷2+1` looks suspiciously similar to `n+2+1` in
`equal_halves(…)`.  For those on Macs, you can type `÷` directly with
`Option-/`.

Unicode quirks aside, the code is clean and pretty easy to read.  The standard
libraries seem complete and accessible.  Arrays / vectors are column-major,
hence the use of `vcat` in the `mapreduce` call.

The approach is pretty straightforward.  The code produces a gigantic list of
numbers, nearly 20 million of them.  For part 1, we just check straightforwardly
whether the length is even and the two halves match.

For part 2, I originally used a regular expression in Kotlin to initially solve
the problem.  It turns out that backtracking regexes are much slower in Julia
than they are in Kotlin— I assume the underlying Java libraries have some
optimisations for specific cases that improved the performance for the regexes I
used.

Fortunately, many posts in the reddit solutions code pointed out that a string
consists of a repeated substring if it is a nontrivial rotation of itself, and
that is the algorithm implemented here.

## Install Julia and run

The modern way to manage Julia versions is `juliaup`.  Regular package managers
work fine too.

```sh
# I installed via Homebrew
brew install julia

# Website recommends running random scripts on your machine
curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh

# Execute the code
julia d02.jl
```
